## ERP Sync
The **ERP Sync** button at the top imports the item master from ERP to **add/update** items in MES. A confirmation modal appears before execution. This can import tens of thousands of items at once, so only run when intended.

## Usage Procedure
1. Click **Add Item** (or ✏️ on a row) to open the slide form.
2. Enter **Identification Info** (item code, part number, item name) and **Classification** (item type).
3. Fill in required fields (specifications, packaging, expiry, etc.) and save.

## FAQ
- **Q.** What is the difference between item code and part number?
  **A.** The item code is the MES internal identifier (recommended to be immutable), while the part number is used in drawings, ERP, and customer documents.
- **Q.** An item was incorrectly added via ERP sync.
  **A.** Items imported via the ERP interface can be cleaned up by an operator (see the operations guide).
